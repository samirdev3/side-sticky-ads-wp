## Side Sticky ADs for WordPress
With the help of this plugin you can place sticky Ads on both side of the website (box layout). You can change the container size under options.php (the default container size is set to 1200px)

Notes:
1. Only works on desktop version.
2. Ads will not be visible if (container width + 2 ad width) is greater then (screen width).
